### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github!

I'm a life-long learning Software Engineer, actively seeking ways to contribute to open source products to boost developer productivity. My current interest lies in front-end state management systems as well as other technologies. Technologies I'm using day to day: GraphQL, React, Redux, Node.js, Python, Typescript, Webpack.   

### Open Source Projects

* Recent post on Reactime 6.0 - a state debugger for React application. Check out the app [here](https://reactime.io/), and the most recent article about Reactime 6.0 [here](https://medium.com/@CSVince/time-traveling-state-with-reactime-6-0-53fdc3ae2a20). 
* SWEetheart 2.0 - a platform to help developers connect to share ideas and build projects together.
* Generosity - a webapp that allows people to easily give away their goods.

### Articles & talks that excite me

* [A Cartoon Intro to Fiber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCuYPiUIONs&t=174s) - by Lin Clark. Watched this and you'd understand how React really works under the hood, more than just the virtual dom. I come to appreciate the complexity that React handles for us after this talk. Isn't it amazing? 

* [MobX vs Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76FRrbY18Bs&t=628s) - by Preethi Kasireddy. If you think that you should always choose Redux, you might be wrong. Thinking about what you want for your application is very important. This talk taught me to think about the trade-off between MobX and Redux and when to use which, or just go with pure React.

* [In The Loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCOL7MC4Pl0&t=23s) - by Jake Archibald. Understanding event loop is the key to the web.
